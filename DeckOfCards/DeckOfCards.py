Problem statement:
Write a Program DeckOfCards.java, to initialize deck of cards having suit
 ("Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades") & Rank
 ("2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace").
 Shuffle the cards using Random method and then distribute 9 Cards to 4 Players 
 and Print the Cards the received by the 4 Players using 2D Arrayâ€¦

 Extend the above program to create a Player Object having Deck of Cards, and having
  ability to Sort by Rank and maintain the cards in a Queue implemented using
   Linked List. Do not use any Collection Library. Further the Player are also arranged
    in Queue. Finally Print the Player and the Cards received by each Player.
